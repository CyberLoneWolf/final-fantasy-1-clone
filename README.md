A currently incomplete "clone" of Final Fantasy One Dawn of Souls. My goal is not at all to completely rewrite FF1 with 100% accuracy but rather to implement the major functionality of the game for learning purposes. Currently parties can be created, and most of the functionality of Cornelia and the main party menu are implemented. There is still a lot of work to be done and people should not download this hoping to play the actual game. If you do want to try it, it can be run on Linux and the WASD and arrow keys can be used for control (or reconfigured in input.cpp).
