walk (requires two frames of animation)
be blocked (but still turn in direction)
get in battles (on world map and in dungeons)
enter new map (doorways, towns)
enter menus (main menu, merchant npcs)
dialog windows (enter new map, talk to npc)
have npcs (in towns, dungeons)
affect hp/mp/status (npc can heal)
some squares on world map dont get battles
some squares on world map get more battles
	- so each square should have its own battle %?
	- e.g.	town path has 0% battles
		forest 7% 5 goblins, 15% 3 goblins, 3% crazy horse
		but not all forests have that, so each forest tile different
character map image depends on lead character

struct Tile {
	bool Walkable;
	unsigned int graphic; // corresponds to array of possible graphics DO BOUNDS CHECKING!
	unsigned char possiblebattles; // how many different battles occur on this tile
	unsigned int battle[possiblebattles]; // corresponds to array of possible battles DO BOUNDS CHECKING
	unsigned char encounterrate; // if (rand % 255) < encounterrate) { BATTLE; }
}

or actually: use large textures
struct Tile {
	bool Walkable;
	// figure out battle stuff later
}
Tile MapData[XTiles][YTiles];

MAP DATA:
0 = not walkable
>1 = town/dungeon entrance (and is the id of where it leads, e.g. 1=worldmap, 2=cornelia, 3=cornelia item shop .. etc...)
-1 = normal walkable tile, (no encounters)
<-1 = enemy group (e.g. -2=grass around cornelia

NPC DATA:
ID
int Moving // store SDL_GetTicks since last movement
int MoveDelay // how quickly npc moves, change this to very low if player is trying to walk where npc is
int StartX, StartY
int CurrentX, CurrentY


map class
reads from file for current map
	e.g. if in cornelia
		will read tiles, npcs, doorways for cornelia map
		load npc data from a seperate file (bool moving/what they say/action id)
	there will need to be two passes of drawing
		one before drawing character
		one after so things can partially cover character
on map change
	delete textures, npcs etc.. for cornelia
	load in new stuff
on walk
	check if walkable
	set walking = SDL_GetTicks(); // this variable will also be for walking delay
	change character sprite
	load percent of tiles on edges based on time passed since walking
	set walking = 0; // only allow movement when walking == 0;
	change character sprite
	if on doorway change map
on npc talk
	create new instance of dialog class
